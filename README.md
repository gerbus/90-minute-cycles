# 90-minute-cycles

## Context
Since the human body sleeps in roughly 90 minute intervals, there may be a physiological benefit to labelling every 90 minute period during the day. It's feasible that the benefits of going to sleep at roughly the same time every night actually arise from the fact that the 90 minute clock of the body is then maintained for more than 24 hours. If true, and the human body responds well to a fixed clock across night and day, noting the timing of cycles during the day may allow one to enhance that rhythm even further (for example, what if you entered a brief meditative state every 90 minutes to coincide with your deep sleep cycle?

Probably not coincidentally, a solar day is perfectly divisible by 90 minute intervals (as it is with 60 minute intervals). If instead of "hours" we talk about "cycles", then instead of 24 hours in a day we have 16 cycles. 

## Product
To start, a clock that runs on 90 minute intervals instead of 60 minute intervals.
