## Sleep Cycle
Since the human body sleeps in roughly 90 minute intervals, there may be a physiological benefit to labelling every 90 minute period during the day. It's feasible that the benefits of going to sleep at roughly the same time every night actually arise from the fact that the 90 minute clock of the body is then maintained for more than 24 hours. If true, and the human body responds well to a fixed clock across night and day, noting the timing of cycles during the day may allow one to enhance that rhythm even further (for example, what if you entered a brief meditative state every 90 minutes to coincide with your deep sleep cycle?

Probably not coincidentally, a solar day is perfectly divisible by 90 minute intervals (as it is with 60 minute intervals). If instead of "hours" we talk about "cycles", then instead of 24 hours in a day we have 16 cycles. 

## Nasal Cycle
There is another well-known cycle that occurs in the body, which is the nasal cycle, supported by the BRAC (basic rest-activity cycle) hypothesis. Yogis have known about this for centuries, and the west since about 1900. [reference](http://sequencewiz.org/2014/08/06/one-nostril-breathing/). This cycle has a mean period of about 4 or 5 hours, which works out to roughly 5 or 6 cycles per day.

Essentially what happens in the nasal cycle is that the body's hemispheres (left/right) switch between sympathetic (fight/flight) and parasympathetic (rest/digest) modes. When the right side of the body is in sympathetic mode, the right nostril is dominant (more open, more airflow) and the body is generally more primed for activity. When the the right side of the body is in parasympathetic mode, the left nostril is dominant and the body is general more relaxed. 

The yogis have practices whereby one blocks a nostril and breathes through the other to activate or relax the body.

## Product
To start, a clock that runs on set intervals (i.e. 90mins/5hrs). Ideally, some kind of feedback about the state of the body (when did nasal dominance switch? when did you wake up, go to sleep?) can calibrate the relevant clocks. Being able to look at one's phone and see where their body is in the sleep cycle, or nasal cycle, can help to understand oneself.
